### Introduction

Hello, Shuttle! This is Yori. Let's talk about how I made this website. It's not a super interesting story, but it's a story.
If you want to just see the source code, head over to [GitHub][this@github]. If you want to know a little more about it, look
no further than the [homepage][home]. Obviously, **this blog post will assume understanding of [Rust][rustlang] and [Shuttle][shuttlers].**
If you are not familiar with either, a lot of this will go over your head.

Alright? alright. Let's go.

The Inspiration
</h2>

Yeah, the shuttle logo gradient doesn't look good on text. I've wanted to use [Svelte][svelte] as a framework for a while, but I
haven't had a reason to. Come November 2023 and Shuttle is running a [Christmas Code Hunt][cch] akin to [Advent of Code][aoc].
What's more, Jeff Mitchell posts [a dedicated page for the hunt][jeffmitchelldiary] and makes the main page a diary about the event,
and the project is apparently using Hyper and Tower. Goodness, Jeff, I do not want to be in your shoes. Push comes to shove, and
my desire to finally use Svelte wins, so I decide to make an entire site dedicated to shuttle blogging. Who knows, maybe someone
would want to read.
